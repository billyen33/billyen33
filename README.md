### Hi there, I'm Bill ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University studying Electrical Engineering. I previously graduated from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, minor in Environmental Engineering, and the Segal Design Certificate.

I am passionate about low power systems, energy harvesting, and sustainable IoT. I've worked with

- Prof. Josiah Hester at [Ka Moamoa Lab](https://kamoamoa.com/) on backscatter-enabled wireless sensors
- Prof. George Wells at [WE BioME Lab](https://www.wells.northwestern.edu/) on robust soil microbial fuel cell design
- Planter Innovation Team at [CNH Industrial](https://www.cnhindustrial.com/) on mobile, multi-depth soil moisture and temperature sensors
- Sustainability Team at [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/) on bio-electrochemical sensors for wastewater monitoring
- AutoAquaponics Team at [Engineers for a Sustainable World](https://esw-nu.github.io/) on fully automated indoor farm
