I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University studying Electrical Engineering. I previously graduated from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, minor in Environmental Engineering, and the Segal Design Certificate.

I am passionate about low power systems, energy harvesting, and sustainable IoT. I've worked with
